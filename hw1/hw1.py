# Problem 1
# Say your research deals with social networks. Your first step is to study the properties of the Facebook network of college students at CU-Boulder campus. The next step is to compare your findings to the national college student Facebook network.
# a) What are the populations you are concerned with?
# b) What is the relationship between these populations?
# c) What are some of the characteristics of the networks you might consider? Pick three as an example.
# d) If you had infinite time and resources, would you be able to measure these characteristics for every member of these populations?
# e) Say you don't have infinite time and resources -- how would you go about estimating those population characteristics?

# Problem 2
# You're working for a US public health surveillance team, keeping an eye on infectious diseases such as the flu in the US.
# a) If your goal is to estimate the average yearly flu infection rate among those over 65 years of age in the US, what is the population you are working with?
# b) Given that surveillance is done only via doctor's offices, what is the actual population of people whose infection rates you'll be observing?
# c) What kind of estimates will you get? Can they be generalized to the entire population you'd like to be working with? Under what assumptions the answer is yes?

# Problem 3
# a) What is the difference between mean, median, and mode? When would you prefer to use one and not the others?
# b) What is the difference between standard deviation and range? When would you report one and not the other to communicate how variable the data are?

# Problem 4
# A friend has given you a 2 pound bag of ordinary M&M's for your birthday. Incidentally, you've recently had a discussion with the same friend who is convinced that the blue ones are less frequent than the other 5 colors (red, yellow, green, orange and brown). You (and the rest of your friends) think that all colors are equally likely. The 2 pound bag has about 1200 M&M's. So to put the matter to rest, you actually counted the M&M's and found there were 1215 in the bag -- and you've found that there are 150 blue ones, 220 red, 230 yellow, 215 orange, 190 green, and 210 brown ones).
# a) Sketch a histogram of the observed relative frequency of colors in that bag
# b) If your friend is not correct (and you are), what would the true relative frequency of colors look like (sketch)
# c) How many blue ones would you expect to see if all colors are equally likely?
# d) Do you think your friend is right, based on the one bag evidence? Give a heuristic answer here - you don't need to be precise. What are some of the limitations of this one-bag "evidence" approach? In an ideal world, how would you design a study to test this more rigorously?

# Problem 5
# The following dataset (sample size=40) is given to you for further analysis in a following text file.
# a) Plot a default histogram in your favorite software package/program. How many bins does it plot by default for this dataset? What is the size of each bin?
# b) Change the number of bins -- first use 10, then 20, and finally 25. What differences (if any) can you see between these histograms and your histogram from part (a)?
# c) Change the starting point to -2, -1.5, and then -1.45 -- and plot a histogram with 25 bins for each. What differences do you see?
# You can also do this problem by hand if you choose. Some programs might not let you change all these "inputs" - so if all else fails, sketches of histograms by hand will be accepted.
