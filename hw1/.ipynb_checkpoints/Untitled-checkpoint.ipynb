You (and the rest of your friends) think that all colors are equally likely. The 2 pound bag has about 1200 M&M's. So to put the matter to rest, you actually counted the M&M's and found there were 1215 in the bag -- and you've found that there are 150 blue ones, 220 red, 230 yellow, 215 orange, 190 green, and 210 brown ones).\n",
